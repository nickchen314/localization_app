## 2. Use Case

Problem Addressed: 
The USAID Localization App is specifically designed to address the critical need for transparency and detailed analysis in the distribution of USAID funding. It focuses on a crucial aspect: quantifying and visualizing the share of funding allocated to local organizations within different countries. This need arises from USAID's ambitious goals set in November 2021 by Administrator Samantha Power, targeting a significant shift towards localization in aid distribution.

Target Users: 
1. Development professionals seeking insights into the effectiveness and distribution of USAID funds.
2. Academic researchers analyzing trends in international aid and its local impact.
3. Members of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly those classified as local, who are interested in understanding their role and representation in receiving aid.
4. General public members, especially those interested in the workings and impacts of international aid.


## 3. Required Packages

The USAID Localization App, developed with R and Shiny, utilizes a range of packages to facilitate its data processing, visualization, and user interface capabilities. Below is a detailed list of the required packages along with their primary functions within the app:

1. shiny: The core framework for building interactive web applications directly from R. It provides the structure for the user interface and server components of the app.
2. tidyverse: A collection of R packages designed for data science. It includes tools for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. Key packages from tidyverse used in the app include dplyr for data manipulation and readr for reading data files.
3. ggplot2: A system for declaratively creating graphics, based on the Grammar of Graphics. It is used for creating advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations within the app.
4. bslib: Provides tools for using Bootstrap in Shiny applications. It is used to apply the Bootstrap 5 'Materia' theme to enhance the app's user interface design.
5. scales: Provides methods for automatically determining break points and labels for axes and legends in ggplot2. It is particularly useful for formatting numeric labels in visualizations.
6. DT: An interface to the JavaScript library DataTables, used in Shiny apps for rendering interactive tables.
7. thematic: Provides tools for simplifying the styling of Shiny apps and R Markdown documents, especially for consistent theming in ggplot2 graphics.
8. shinyWidgets: Extends the basic set of Shiny widgets with more sophisticated and customizable input widgets.
9. plotly: An R package for creating interactive web-based graphics via the open source JavaScript graphing library Plotly.js. It is used to render interactive versions of ggplot2 graphics.

Additionally, the app incorporates custom functions and data processing scripts, as indicated in the business logic section. These include reading in data from RDS files, manipulating and joining data frames, defining UI elements, and setting up reactive elements for dynamic data visualization.


## 4. Data Source and Structure
The default data sources are two sets of RDS files: contracts_prime and grants_prime, which contain data regarding contracts and grants respectively. These data sources are located in a directory named data-raw, as indicated by the file paths in the scripts ("./data-raw/contracts.rds" and "./data-raw/grants.rds").

The general structure of the data, after processing through the func_clean_df function mentioned in app.R, is a single data frame named joined_df. This joined data frame contains variables from both the contracts and grants data sets. The exact variables included in joined_df are not fully listed in the vignette provided, but based on the operations in the scripts, we can infer some of the variables include:

1. total_obligated_amount: The financial obligation amount for the grant or contract.
2. award_base_action_date_fiscal_year: The fiscal year of the award date.
3. primary_place_of_performance_country_name: The country where the contract or grant work is performed.
4. is.local: A logical variable indicating whether the place of performance is the same as the recipient's country.
5. is.grant: A logical variable indicating whether the record is a grant (TRUE) or a contract (FALSE).

Further, the data frames undergo various transformations, such as mutating to create new variables or filtering based on user input from the Shiny application interface.

For exploratory data analysis, the eda.R script loads CSV files with seemingly more recent data (Contracts_PrimeAwardSummaries_2023-10-01_H04M40S14_1.csv and Assistance_PrimeAwardSummaries_2023-10-09_H17M29S35_1.csv). It then selects certain columns for analysis and joins the data frames, similarly creating a joined_df. This EDA script also introduces a variable is.local to identify whether the performance country matches the recipient country and conducts an initial count of missing values (NAs) for the is.local variable and the total_obligated_amount.
