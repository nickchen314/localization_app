## USAID Localization App

This project proposes to analyze USAID contracts and projects spending data from [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/) to analyze the share of USAID funding that goes to local organizations within a country.

### Topic and Data

**Context and Literature Review** 

In November 2021, USAID Administrator Samantha Power announced [two ambitious agency wide goals](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/FY%202022%20Localization%20Progress%20Report-June-12-23_vFINAL_1.pdf): "(1) USAID will provide at least a quarter of its program funds directly to local partners by the end of FY 2025, and (2) by 2030, 50 percent of Agency programming will place local communities in the lead to set priorities, co-design projects, drive implementation, and evaluate the impact of its programs." 

This commitment to move towards “localization,” or the empowerment of local actors in leading and distributing aid, is important for two reasons.  First, localization can ameliorate [criticisms](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2023.2241257) that U.S foreign aid efforts are colonial projects designed either to advance geopolitical interests or to fill the pockets of “beltway bandits.”  Second, localization can [improve the effectiveness](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/evidence-based-localization-can-existing-evidence-help-guide-usaids-localization-agenda) of aid projects by increasing flexibility, accountability, and contextual knowledge.

Despite these ambitious goals, USAID has provided little in the way of transparent methods to keep track of localization’s progress.  In fact, USAID’s past localization calculations have been [criticized](https://www.devex.com/news/usaid-overestimating-localization-spending-transparency-group-claims-105069) for overestimating shares of local funding.  As of October 2023, no methodologically rigorous localization analysis has been made for USAID contracts and grants that has both wide geographic and temporal coverage.

**Data Source**

To analyze aid localization, this project will use the [USASpending api](https://api.usaspending.gov/) to pull contracts and grants level data for USAID (filtering by agency = USAID).

The dataset contains roughly 68,000 USAID grants and contracts from 1998 to the present.  The USASpending database is updated frequently with new contracts and grants information and is frequently updated by USAID as part of their
